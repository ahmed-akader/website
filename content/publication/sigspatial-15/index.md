abstract: "The NewsStand system enables the use of a map query interface to retrieve news articles associated with the principal locations that they mention collected as a result of monitoring the output of over 10,000 RSS news feeds, made available within minutes of publication. NewsStand has been enhanced to allow using the map query interface to access other information associated with the articles such as photos and videos, as well as names of people and diseases mentioned in these articles. Here we report on our efforts to enhance NewsStand to display the names of brands and to the articles mentioning them. The challenges in identifying interesting brand mentions are discussed."
