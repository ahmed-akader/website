abstract: Over the past decade, polyhedral meshing has been gaining popularity as a better alternative to tetrahedral meshing in certain applications. Within the class of polyhedral elements, Voronoi cells are particularly attractive thanks to their special geometric structure. What has been missing so far is a Voronoi mesher that is sufficiently robust to run automatically on complex models. In this video, we illustrate the main ideas behind the VoroCrust algorithm, highlighting both the theoretical guarantees and the practical challenges imposed by realistic inputs.
