The introduction presented here is mainly based on Edelsbrunner and Harer’s [Computational Topology](https://www.worldcat.org/title/computational-topology-an-introduction/oclc/1025448222), while drawing doses of inspiration from Ghrist’s [Elementary Applied Topology](https://www2.math.upenn.edu/~ghrist/notes.html); it is mostly self-contained, at the expense of brevity and less rigor here and there to fit the short span of one or two lectures. An excellent textbook to consult is Hatcher’s Algebraic Topology, which is freely [available online](https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/AT.pdf).
