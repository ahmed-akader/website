I am a postdoc fellow with the Oden Institute at UT Austin hosted by Prof. Chandrajit Bajaj. My current research concerns efficient learning from spatio-temporal data as generated by either visual sensors or scientific experiments. I obtained my PhD in Computer Science from the University of Maryland at College Park, where I was advised by Prof. David Mount. During my PhD, I spent a lot of time at Sandia National Laboratories mostly working on meshing algorithms, where I was hosted by Scott Mitchell and Mohamed Ebeida. Prior to all that, I studied computer engineering and TA'ed many math/CS undergraduate classes at Alexandria University in Egypt.
