Like our minds, our computers can only access the real world through hardware providing sensing, mobility, and interaction capabilities. Such cyber-physical systems require efficient algorithms for data processing and action planning. As a matter of fact, my early research on visual surveillance served as my main motivation to pursue advanced studies in computational geometry and theoretical computer science in general.

My research work in cyber-physical systems revolves around monitoring tasks, e.g., for security and public safety, as well as cinematography applications. My very first research project developed a low-cost approach for target detection and tracking using wifi signals based on simple pattern recognition algorithms. After that, I worked on many projects dealing with cameras a.k.a. *directional visual sensors*. My research work provided efficient solutions to a variety of problems in sensor placement including the assignment of optimal orientations for fixed cameras, e.g., pan-tilt-zoom cameras, as well as the optimal location and orientation of mobile cameras, e.g., camera-mounted drones. In addition, I studied pursuit-evasion games between two mobile agents developing efficient algorithms for optimal strategies in grid world environments with arbitrary obstacles.

My background in cyber-physical systems, and formal training in computational geometry, help me appreciate recent developments in this area. Besides continuing to review for leading robotics venues, I am particularly interested in the challenges involved in autonomous driving and keep revisiting those themes in my ongoing research investigations.
